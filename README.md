# Project for the course "AK7PD"

## Description

This project is a simple implementation of a MongoDB with backend in golang and frontend in nextjs.

## How to run

First, you have to open the terminal and go to folder `backend` and run the command `go run main.go`. This will start the backend server.

Then, you have to open another terminal and go to folder `frontend` and run the command `bun run dev`. This will start the frontend server.

-   If you dont have the `go` installed, you can install it with the command `sudo apt install golang-go`.
-   If you dont have the `bun` installed, you can install it with the command `npm install -g bun`.

-   If you need to install the dependencies, you can run the command `go mod tidy` in the `backend` folder and `bun install` in the `frontend` folder.
